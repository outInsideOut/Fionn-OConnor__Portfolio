			<h3>sudoku solving program/algorithm<br>
			Python project</h3>
			<p>I have always really enjoyed sudoku puzzles.<br> 
				They engage my logically and pass the time well<br>
			After studying object orientated programming I could see a clear abstraction of the puzzle and wanted to have a crack at writing a program to solve them.<br>
			Having never used python before and hearing that it is a good language to know I decided to try use this project as an opportunity to learn</p>

			<h3>proGlide Lincoln.ltd - Website Development</h3>
			<p>Whilst studying Computer Science in my first year at University of Lincoln we did a module in Web Authoring which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br> 
				In the summer after I started asking in local circles if anybody had a business that needed a website and found proGlide garage doors.<br>
			The website is almost complete and I am just waiting for confirmation before hosting it for them also.</p>

			<h3>Call Compliance Calculator</h3>
			<p>The first piece of software I developed:<br>
				While working in a call centre I was asked to 
			develop a tool to help the managers derive how many green calls where needed by an agent to get a desired percentage overall<br>
			At the time I only knew HTML and CSS but quickly learned how to do simple calculations with javascript.<br>..And there was born a love of programming</p>
