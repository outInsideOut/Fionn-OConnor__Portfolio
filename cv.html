		<h2><br>PORTFOLIO</h2>
		<a href="https://outinsideout.github.io/Portfolio/">https://outinsideout.github.io/Portfolio/</a>
		<h2><br>PROFILE</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently in my third year of a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Lincoln. I am thoroughly enjoying my course. I finished my second year with a high first-class grade and am aiming to continue at that standard. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working a variety of jobs has given me skill to be able to communicate well with anybody, professionally or casually. Self-employment has honed my ability consult with clients on work needed and prices, discussing technology and software development, in laymen’s terms. Being self-employed has also taught me great discipline in being self-managed and motivated within my work.<br><br>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love to solve problems. From logic-puzzles to puzzle-puzzles, real-world to pure simulation I just really love to solve problems. There’s that satisfaction of solving, fixing or improving something that is priceless to me. I have always taught myself things: juggling, guitar, some programming languages & paradigms and many more skills. The quest for knowledge is one I hope to never give up.</p>
